A analysis for the New York Citi Bike Program, in which responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program for 300,000+ data points in the United States
in order to generate business insights in terms of visulize the peak time in both summer and winter period and the top start location in New York City and Jersey City, New Jersey.  Due to data size and limitations, i used the Jersey City data for 2020 to create my dashboards. I have included various figures that were created within my workbook to feed into the dashboard.  I have also inluded the link to my dashboards and workbooks below in the dashboard section.

# Limitation
The data was split in three different categories for gender.  One of the genders was listed as unkown.  This could have been for a number of reasons.  However, that ultimately skews the data as to which gender is a bigger user of the bike.

# Data Source

This Citi Bike Data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length
(potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it's secure).

# Dashboard Views
Below, I have attached static views of my two dashboards.  I have attached the link to the live dashboard if you would like to see the dashboard in motion.

# Findings

* (1) The current popular start and stop stations appear to be located around more populated areas, rail stations, and major highways within Jersey City. 


* (2) The 1st and 2nd peak hours during a day would usually be 7-8 AM and 5-6 PM season-regardless

* (3) As the temperature gets cold as winter begins, people tend not to ride as well because of the lack of comfort individuals face when riding in low temperatures. Therefore, at some point the ridership does not grow. However, the total amount of annual member have been kept increased over time in 2020.
